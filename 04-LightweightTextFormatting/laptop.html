<h1>Laptop</h1>
<p>A laptop computer or notebook computer, also known as a laptop or notebook, is a small, portable personal computer (PC).<br>Laptops typically have a clamshell form factor with a flat-panel screen on the inside of the upper lid and an alphanumeric keyboard and pointing device on the inside of the lower lid. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop">link</a></p>
<p>Types of laptops:<br>Laptops are used in a variety of settings, such as at work (especially on business trips), in education, for playing games, content creating, web browsing, for personal multimedia, and for general home computer use.
They can run on both AC power and built-in rechargable batteries, and can be folded shut for convenient storage and transportation, making them suitable for mobile use.
Laptops combine essentially the same input/output components and capabilities of a desktop computer into a single unit, including a display screen (usually 11–17 in or 280–430 mm in diagonal size), small speakers, a keyboard, and a pointing device (usually touchpads).</p>
